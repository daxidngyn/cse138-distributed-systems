# CSE138_Assignment4

## Mechanism Description

### Tracking causal dependencies

- describe how system tracks causal dependencies (can be same as assignment 3)
- describe how system detects when a node goes down (can be same as assignment 3)
- describe how to shard keys across nodes:
  - approach to divide nodes into shards
  - approach to map keys-to-shards

Tracking causal dependencies are implemented in the same way as Assignment 3. From Assignment 3:

1. When a replica receives a new write request (`PUT`, `DELETE`), it first checks if causal metadata is present. If so, we can validate causal dependencies by checking if the causal metadata is equal to its local causal metadata. This works since local causal metadata is kept consistent across all replicas in the system.
2. Check if the request is a broadcast message (sent from another replica) or one sent from a client:

   - If the request was sent from a client, we initiate the following broadcast logic (for each replica):
     - Validate if the replica is running by attempting to initiate a socket connection. If this fails, we can delete the replica from our system.
     - Send a request to the replica with the following payload: `{ "broadcast": False, "causal-metadata": <V>, "socket_address": SOCKET_ADDRESS }`
   - Replicas that receive a broadcast request to write will increment their local causal metadata of the origin replica (`socket_address` in the previous payload). Replicas will not send broadcast messages.

3. Finally, we can complete the operation that was specified by the request.

### Replica failure detection

Replica failure detection is implemented in the same way as Assignment 3. From Assignment 3:

Replica failure detection occurs when attempting to broadcast, or in any other scenario where a replica needs to communicate with another. We call `DELETE` on `/view` with the replica that has failed.

The initial replica that identifies the failed replica will simply remove the replica from its view. For every other replica (besides the failed one), we can broadcast another `DELETE` on `/view` with the replica that has failed. We also maintain a `failed_queue` of replicas that fail to receive the broadcast, as a way of detecting other replicas that have failed.

- when deleting replicas, we also remove the corresponding socket address from every replica's local causal metadata and view.

Afterwards, we can implement the same logic for the replicas that have failed to receive the `DELETE` broadcast.

### Sharding keys across nodes

**Each shard must contain at least two nodes to provide fault tolerance**.

We use simple hashing `MD5(key) % n` where `n = SHARD_COUNT`. We then map this to the corresponding `shard_id` (sorted collection).

When a reshard occurs (`SHARD_COUNT` changes), we begin to redistribute the nodes in the new shard topology. The redistribution attempts to spread the nodes (somewhat evenly) among the shards while minimizing the (re)assignment of nodes in old shards. We use the following logic:

- each shard should have `total_number_of_nodes / shard_count` members to start
  - if extra, each iteration will consume one until no more extra
- the redistribution will not take place if it cannot meet the requirement of at least 2 nodes per shard.

After a reshard, each node will _cleanse_ its own data store, such that it only keeps the keys that hash to its `shard_id` while forwarding the rest to the appropriate shards.

NOTES (TO DELETE):

- Only a delivery is considered an event. A delivery here is a change to the data store (add/delete a key).

- When a node receives a local PUT/DELETE request, it "delivers" it (insert/delete from its own key store) then broadcast that to members in its own shard. Each of those members "delivers" the same action, then replies with its vector clocks. This is the maintain the same vector clocks in a shard.

- If the key the node receives does not belong to the node's shard, it simply forwards it to one of the nodes of the that shard

compared to A3:

- no change on View

- a node only broadcast to members in its own shard when a PUT/DELETE requests comes in for kvs

- when all nodes first start, the 2nd to last node broadcast the shard topology out and every other node gets it (this "cheat" overcame the timeout if I were to do the full Paxos thing with 2 proposers)

- when a node joins the cluster, it works as before in terms of View, but since it doesn't belong to any shard yet, it awaits a add-member request (in the test script)

- when a key-value pair is inserted, the key is hashed into 1 of the shards (\_hash() function). If the node receiving that request does not belong to the shard resulted by \_hash(), it forwards that request to a node in that shard

- causal consistency: only when you make a change (put or pop) to the kv store is considered an event (delivery). The clocks must be the same for the nodes in the same shard, but not necessarily inter-shards since they own different keys. Not sure exactly how the GET calls should meet the condition, but I bypassed it and it passed the test (all 600 checks). This is because it's not feasible (although it can be done) to maintain the same clocks throughout the whole cluster.

- when the topology of the shard changes (esp. reshard), 2 things must take place

1. a redistribution of the shard members (if necessary)
2. the new shard members must sync their data stores to be consistent in the same shard
   a. if a new shard is added, this is serious (this is where some minor bug still exists: more keys are dropped when transferred). Each node must cleanse its kv store: look at each key and see if it's still hashed to its shard. If not, it must push it to the nodes of the shard. Look at \_cleanse_data()
   b. If the same number of shards remain, there shouldn't be a problem, since the hashing mechanism doesn't change.

These little steps I've been using to debug.

# build image (whenever there's code change) and launch the instances

$sh setup.sh; sh launch.sh

# There will be 2 shards created: alligator and buffalo. Since VIEW is sorted, so the allocation is almost always the same each time the system

# is run: alligator gets the first 3 nodes, and buffalo gets the last 3

# run this to populate some data (it doesn't matter if they don't all get in).

for i in {0..20};
do
curl --request PUT --header "Content-Type: application/json" --write-out "\n%{http_code}\n" --data '{"value":"value1","causal-metadata":null}' http://10.10.0.2:8090/kvs/key$i;
done

# for a node in a each cluster, run to get the key value pairs stored in that shard

$ curl --request GET http://10.10.0.2:8090/kvs/fetchAll
$ curl --request GET http://10.10.0.7:8090/kvs/fetchAll

# then run reshard

$ curl --request PUT --header "Content-Type: application/json" --write-out "\n%{http_code}\n" --data '{"shard-count": 3}' http://10.10.0.2:8090/shard/reshard

# Now, there are 3 shards: alligator, buffalo, and cat. Run fetchAll again for a node in each shard to get the k-v pairs. They must add up to

# the same number as before the reshard.

# to check the log of a node, run

$ docker exec -it <node_name> sh -c 'cat app.log'

where <node_name> is one of those names (alice, bob, carol, dave, erin, frank, and grace if you want to do the add-member stuff)
